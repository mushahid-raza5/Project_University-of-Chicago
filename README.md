# Project_University-of-Chicago
This repository contains the projects I have completed individually and collaboratively during my Master of Science in Applied Data Science program at the University of Chicago. Each project reflects hands-on experience in data analysis, modeling, and real-world problem-solving using data-driven methodologies.
