# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and documentation.

## Organization

Notebooks should be organized by:
- Project (consider keeping notebooks within project directories)
- Topic or analysis type
- Chronological order (use prefixes like `01_`, `02_`, etc.)

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names that indicate the notebook's purpose
- Include markdown cells to explain your analysis and findings
- Clear all output before committing (to reduce repository size)
- Consider using notebook extensions for better formatting
- Keep notebooks focused on a single task or analysis

## Naming Convention Examples

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`
- `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`
- `03_model_training.ipynb`
- `04_results_visualization.ipynb`
