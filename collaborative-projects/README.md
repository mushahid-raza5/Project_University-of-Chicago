# Collaborative Projects

This directory contains projects completed collaboratively with other students during the Master of Science in Applied Data Science program.

## Structure

Each collaborative project should be organized in its own subdirectory with the following recommended structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md          # Project description, team members, and contributions
├── data/              # Project-specific data (if not too large)
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks with analysis
├── src/               # Source code files
├── results/           # Output files, visualizations, reports
├── docs/              # Additional documentation
└── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies (if applicable)
```

## Team Projects Best Practices

- Clearly document each team member's contributions
- Use version control effectively with meaningful commit messages
- Maintain consistent code style and documentation
- Include a section in the README acknowledging all contributors

## Adding a New Project

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add a README.md explaining the project and listing team members
3. Include all relevant code, notebooks, and documentation
4. Update the main repository README with a link to your project
