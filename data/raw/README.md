# Raw Data

This directory contains original, unprocessed datasets.

## Guidelines

- Keep raw data immutable - never modify the original files
- Document the source and date of acquisition for each dataset
- For large files, use cloud storage and provide download links
- Include metadata or data dictionaries when available
